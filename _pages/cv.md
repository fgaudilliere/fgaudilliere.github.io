Teaching & Scientific Outreach
======

<p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Experimental Project in Biology</b>
<br>I am supervising students as they try to come up with their own experimental project to study an aspect of diauxic growth in <i> E. coli</i>. At the end of the semester, I will help them conduct their lab experiments and interpret their results.
<br><i>2023</i></p>


<p style="margin-left: 40px"><b>Genomics workshop for the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, Institut Pasteur</b>
<br>I taught a course about insertion sequences and helped the students while they learned how to use various genomics and epidemiological tools.
