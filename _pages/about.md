## About my research

I am a third-year PhD student in the [TrEE team](https://tree-timc.github.io/compbio/) at [TIMC](https://www.timc.fr/en) in Grenoble (France). My research focuses on **insertion sequences** (IS), which are the simplest class of prokaryotic transposable elements: they only code for a transposase, the enzyme that catalyzes their movement within genomes. I'm interested in how their movement contributes to **prokaryotic genome evolution and adaptation**. I combine wet lab with dry lab approaches: at the bench, I try to determine **how selection filters IS insertions** on a short timescale. At my computer, I analyze the **distribution of IS** in a wide range of prokaryotic genomes to explore IS dynamics on a longer timescale.

I'm supervised by **Ivan Junier** and **Thomas Hindr√©**: Ivan is a biophysicist and helps me analyze my large datasets, and Thomas is a microbiologist who helps me design and carry out my wet lab experiments. **Sophie Abby** also occasionally helps me out when I need to deal with a problem related to prokaryotic phylogeny.

If this sounds interesting to you, feel free to reach out to discuss my research!

## About me

In my spare time, I do amateur photography (you can see a few samples [here](instagram.com/floragaudilliere)). I also play the violin (and sometimes the saxophone, much to my neighbour's dismay) and watch a lot of movies (not necessarily good ones).
